There are 5 problems on the topic of string algorithms in this repository.


Min automat is the solution of the problem:
A deterministic finite state machine A is given.
It is necessary to find the minimum possible number of states in the DFA, which is equivalent to it.

bor is the solution of the problem:
Given a set of strings and a number n.
It is necessary to find the number of different lines of length n that do not contain any of the strings as substrings.

Aho-caras is the solution of the problem:
Given two strings - P and T, no more than 100,000. The string T consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
The string P also consists of lowercase Latin letters, but it can also contain from 0 to 10 characters, 
each of which can replace one letter. You need to find all the positions i in the T string, 
from which it is possible to enter P into T, if somehow replace the characters with letters.

Review_bor is the simple solution of previous task.



z-function is the solution of the problem:
You are given the string s. It is necessary to calculate the Z-function s - for each i from 1 to | s |
